# Lukas - Backend Engineer

## My typical day

### Start of the day

My working day starts between 6 and 10 am. My days vary, but I am always in the office before our Standup meeting. The time when we hold it changes, but currently it's 10:30 am. Sometimes I leave my home just after I wake up, sometimes I start working from home for a little (or larger) while before heading to the office.

At the beginning of a working day, **I review Pull Requests** of other colleagues on GitHub. Getting and giving feedback increases the code quality which is very important for us. _Do you think that this slows us down and it takes ages to deploy something?_ Not exactly! Because of our awesome team, very few open Pull Requests live more than 2 days in our repositories and quite a big amount of them are merged within 24 hours. It's not just the awesomeness of the team, but also the fact we try to keep the PRs rather smaller.

Before lunch, we hold the standup. We usually keep it short, but we are still able to eat half a bowl of popcorn before we finish (no, we're not slow talkers, only fast eaters).

### Lunch

Our office is located in the city center so when the lunchtime comes, we go out to eat somewhere nearby. Sometimes we order a take out. Especially on Wednesdays we order food for most of our engineering team (those who are interested) and watch a video of a speaker giving a talk at some conference. That in practice means surprising a random restaurant nearby with an order for 15 people.

### What do I do

My main job as a developer is to **implement features that provide value** to our customers. It's not that narrow as it sounds, though. As a developer in Pipedrive, I am responsible for the **full development process**. From making sure the requirements are complete, through implementation itself, (automatic) testing, deployment, monitoring and yes, of course, sometimes even bug fixing. Next to that I collaborate with other colleagues, review PRs, discuss issues and have fun!

I write mainly backend code, but when there is an opportunity to do some frontend I am not very worried to dive in. I see touching the frontend code as a great opportunity to learn with the help of my awesome colleagues who master the React library. The team, therefore, helps me grow!

### How do we work

Our team is very **self-organized** and **autonomous**. There's no big brother in the shadow telling me what to do at each point of the day. We have quite a good overview of what others are working on and when I have nothing to do, we either discuss it during the standup or I can choose (to some extent, we still prioritize) what kind of issues I would prefer working on. _Isn't that great?_

Since we **deploy often**, we have a very good automatic infrastructure that brings my code to production in around 20 minutes. That enables me to deploy my code to production usually multiple times a day! I love that. This all is of course only possible because we use automatic tests quite extensively. I don't usually check that everything is working in production after my deploy is done because I have a very good guarantee from those tests. And if it wouldn't work, our monitoring tools would let me know in an instant.

Sometimes the code I write is new features, sometimes improvements to our codebase, and sometimes fix for a bug. **improvements and refactoring** are important to us. We try to refactor often and in small batches when writing new code. That way our codebase quality keeps (hopefully) growing and it has its limit in infinity, let's hope we reach it, someday.

## Why am I in Pipedrive

- Because we create a great product
- Because the team is awesome and it's a lot of fun in the office
- Because we deploy fast and often and deliver great features with outstanding quality
- Because I love it here and I can't imagine it would be better anywhere else ;-)
