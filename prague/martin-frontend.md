# Martin - Frontend Engineer

## The work I do

As a front-end developer, I like to spend most of my time in the React part of our codebase, creating new components, improving old ones, adding and improving functionality and code style, making sure our code is understandable and reusable. I am used to writing my own tests, styling pixel perfect components and making sure the overall UI experience in the product we own is as good as it can be. I commonly discuss requirements for changes and opportunities for improvement with designers and pms making sure our results match with their ideas.   

Every day I do code reviews, trying to give my peers valuable feedback and I am always trying to get some from them on the work I am doing. I am always trying to help others and share my product and code knowledge.

Thanks to having Javascript also on backend, I can easily work with the api, adding any changes I need. In order to work effectively, I am somewhat skilled and knowledgable of our daily work tools that include efficient work with git, having some understanding of how docker containers work and how are they connected with  service discovery with consul, I am also used to working our workflow automation tools and our deployment system and I am also used to hunting down bugs from our logs - but with all of these things I got familiar on the job and this is where I am looking for improvement every day.  

## What is keeping me here

It’s something you will hear over and over again about Pipedrive, but I still think it’s really hard to stress amazing the culture here is and this holds true for your day to day communication with other people, but also for the engineering culture we have. On my first day it was clear that everyone is just trying to be good to each other and enjoy the work environment they are in. Everyone in the company is super helpful, but also, and maybe more importantly, very driven. 

The engineering culture we have is focused around improving and teaching. It is always a priority to learn more and to teach others around you, but when it comes to improvement, it is not just about us, but also about the code we work on. We are always trying to come up with better ways to do the next thing and always looking back at the work we have done, and how it can be made better with gradual improvements.
