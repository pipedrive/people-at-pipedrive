# Jakub - Lead Engineer

## My typical day

My typical day is still mostly spent on delivering features, by that I mean taking part of the whole feature lifecycle.
From discussing the requirements with PMs to designing the architecture, developing and reviewing the code. 
All of the above is a collaborative process with the whole mission team involved.

Another part of my job is spotting opportunities for improvements in how the tribe works together.
Recently, we introduced a knowledge sharing sessions, improved time to have the code reviewed, tried mob programming, etc.

I am able to spend quite a lot of my day on improving the code quality.
That will pay of greatly in the long term.
I mean things like improving monitoring, code structure, reducing technical debt, etc.

The last thing is hiring - we have very ambitious plans when it comes to growing the Prague office.
For that we need to hire a lot of great engineers and that takes a lot of time and effort.
Fortunately, we don't make compromises and hire for quality instead of quantity.

## Why I like working here

As should be obvious from the first part of this page, my job is super varied.
Every day is different and I love that.

We have a great team in Prague, everyone supports each other and we truly care about each other.
That's what keeps me motivated.

The culture is collaborative and gives everyone the choice to do what they are best at.
That suits me.
I am trusted to decide how to contribute and how to be impactful.

## What I needed to know prior to becoming a Lead Engineer

Two things:

- experience with a range of technologies used in a large scale application
- experience with leading a small team
