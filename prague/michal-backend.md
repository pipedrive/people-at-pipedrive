# Michal - Backend engineer

## My typical day
My typical day starts around 9. Usually i would check my slack and open PR’s so others can deploy their features live. 

Am I currently on a mission? Let’s work on some new features on the mission Jira dashboard.
Deploying new feature is done by adding label in Github’s PR and in 10 minutes is in production. It’s really that easy.

Launchpad is there to do better logging, fixing some bugs, refactoring things which you can think they would appreciate little bit of extra care. But it’s not always about fixing and doing support. There are even some small improvements for the product. You can use and test new things which can help our codebase. In last month we started with DDD, currently shifting from classic integer ID to the GUID in our database or using Jest instead of Mocha. Those things are discussed on regular meetings once per week with rest of the team.

There is a Nintendo Switch in the office with a few games and it’s not just a decoration. We play each day Rocket league, there are even some board games for games nights. 


## So why did I chose Pipedrive?

	Working on truly international project which is widely used around the world (even on Antarctica!)
	Missions & Tribes - This is next level to the widely used 2 weeks sprints in a most companies
	Everyday english as a main language is a big plus
	Super team of awesome people with a lot of experiences. 
	Improving my typescript and javascript knowledge of course

## My next goal
