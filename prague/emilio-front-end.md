# Emilio - Jr Frontend Engineer

## My typical day

My typical day in Pipedrive mostly involves writing frontend code for either one of two scenarios. For a mission where I work on developing new features for a particular product. Or launchpad where we improve or fix existing features, or even sometimes introduce smaller features. My work in Pipedrive is always flowing nothing ever feels stale or static.

Additionally to writing my own code, my day also involves reviewing my teammates pull requests. There is such focus on quality on Pipedrive and in the team, that this practice is heavily promoted and rewarded. Needless to say, pull request's reviews are alway done in a constructive way that has only the intent for improving code and product quality.

Not daily but quite on a regular basis the team will gather around and have engineering meetings of various kinds.These meetings can have the purpose of either improving or discussing future of the product, pitching and idea, technology or practice, or to share some knowledge on a particular topic.

Finally, it goes without saying that my day also involves squeezing a little session of video games or other activity with my colleagues. :video_game:

## What's keeping me here

The first reason has to definitely be the people, I am surrounded by a team of people that support and guide each other. This support is always done with the objective of improvement always in mind. Personally being part of this great team and thanks to their feedback and teaching I have been able to improve myself both in hard and soft skills, and will continue to do so, as everyone is always motivated no never stop growing.

Next, event though my current position is frontend, during my time in Pipedrive I have been able to explore areas of development which are outside of my confort zone. In my specific scenario, I have been motivated to work with backend code a bit more, which has further helped me improve my skills and improve my confidence, and showed me that I would like to transition to a fullstack skillset in the future.

Furthermore, I appreciate the feeling of independence that each tribe/mission/person has in the sense that we are able to choose either technologies, practices or techniques that we consider fit best for a particular scenario.

Finally, but not less important its the working environment in Pipedrive. Even thought what we do is serious technical work, the office is always surrounded with smiles and laughter, and a high feeling of camaraderie. I think it is very easy in our modern world to feel like a machine, but Pipedrive has always reinforced the human side where you can actually enjoy your day to day work.

## What I needed to know prior to becoming a Frontend Engineer

- Overall knowledge of web applications development.
- General webdev technologies, practices and tools (git, terminal usage, npm, etc).
- Javascript - React (Typescript was a plus as the team was slowly shifting towards it) and modern CSS knowledge and practices.
- Knowledge on unit testing for Javascript.

## TLDR:

Pipedrive is an amazing space to work on great and quality products, learn and improve great skills and develop yourself, and be surrounded by great people on a great environment.  :rocket:
