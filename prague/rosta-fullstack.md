# Rosta - Full Stack Engineer

One of the reasons I joined Pipedrive was that they allowed me to work **part-time** while finishing my masters. Nobody really
insists on being in the office 9 to 5, therefore everything is just about an arrangement.


## My typical day

First thing to mention - at Pipedrive, I never had to push myself to go to work. Like really. 

My day usually starts with reviewing PRs that I havent seen since the time I left the day before. Depending on whether working on a 
[Mission or being part of Launchpad](https://medium.com/pipedrive-developers/scaling-pipedrive-engineering-from-teams-to-tribes-8f14fd92df8c) the duties differ a bit.

At the start of each mission the focus is more on talking/thinking/designing. At the end of the mission its usually mostly coding, testing. The features we develop during missions are almost immediately tested by our real customers (even if its just a tiny part of them) so the tasks can easily change during the mission quite fast. Welcome to agile!

We deploy multiple times a day to the production and our avareage deploy time including integration tests takes no more than 10 minutes. So its not that special that your code changes end up in production the day you come back to Prague from Talinn.

Launchpad part of the job is mostly improving the codebase - finishing whatever debts were left during the missions, improving dev enviroment, refactoring. This helps the whole team to work faster, better. Nobody tells us what to do, its us coming up with ideas at our Engineering meetings (usually once a week for an hour) where anyone can come up with a topic to discuss (e.g. using trailing comma,  Mocha vs. Jest, etc.)

## What's keeping me here

Before joining Pipedrive I got my priorities straight:
1. improving my dev skills (`javascript`/`typescript`, ideally both front and backend)
2. working on a global product that makes sense
3. english talking enviroment where I would feel great
4. possibility to work part-time

This is exactly what I got here and I cant be happier.

Few more things to mention:
- before actually joining Prague Team, you will need to go to Talinn for an onboarding :rocket: - God I enjoyed it!
- they say its never good to be _the wisest one in the room_ - and I am faaar from being that...

## What I needed to know prior to becoming a Fullstack Engineer

Besides basic things such as git, shell, latest javascript its also great to know some typescript basics. If youve already programmed at least one production project in typescript you are well prepared to join us. For example I knew well that my weak point was writing tests. Lucky me - I did not have to write any tests during the interview :smiley: I focused on that part afterwards and now its a whole different story.
